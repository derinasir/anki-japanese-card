# Anki Japanese Cards

Thanks for looking at my card design.
I didn't create them with purpose of sharing. Because of that you need to copy and paste this code in your Anki app.

## How to use
1. Copy the code inside `styles.css` and paste it into Anki's `Styling` section.

2. Within the `front.html` copy everything inside the `<body>` tag, paste it into Anki's `Front Template` section, rename `body` tags as `div`.

3. Repeat last step for `back.html`.


####Â Optional but recommended
- Download fonts from Google Fonts (links below) and install them onto your computer.

- Set up AwesomeTTS plugin (this might not work instantly. You need to set up TTS service yourself.)

## Features
- Fields for Kun and On readings
- Click the Kanji on back side to look up at Jisho.org
- Fields for adding example words (optional)
